		<p>The passion for hairstyling started back in Guatemala where Sonia was born and raised. She started working at a salon just helping out around cleaning at a very young age. She fell in love with the profession.
Coming here to the United states she has various jobs but they all lead to her working in a salon as an experienced hair stylist. She worked in several hair salons, before she landed where she currently works. Over the years a friendship grew between her & Lynne Short. They met while both working at a hair salon called Meca, which closed down about a decade ago. Long story short Sonia bought her first hair salon and shortly after her long time friend Lynne and her reunited working together. Over the years the business has been running succesfully, With new and old clients D'Rosmy Beauty Salon helping keep its reputation very well</p>
