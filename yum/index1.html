			<li> 1 Wash the spinach and remove the stems only if they are thick and hard.</li>
			<li> 2. Put the leaves in a large pan, cover with a lid, and set over low heat until the leaves crumple into a soft mass. They will steam in the water that clings to them in 1 to 2 min. Drain well.</li> 
			<li> 3. Heat the garlic in 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan until the aroma rises. Add the chopped preserved lemon peel, the chopped olives and the cooked spinach. Season with salt and pepper, mix well, and cook over high heat for a moment or two.</li>
			<li> 4. Stir in the remaining oil, garnish with the reserved olives, and serve cold.</li>
